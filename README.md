# Car Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project analyzes a car dataset to uncover trends and insights about various factors such as selling price, year of manufacturing, and duplicates in the data. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and key insights about car sales. At the end of the analysis, the code recommends the top 5 cars among the preferred options based on the price-to-mileage ratio and engine specifications.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling duplicates and formatting issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into selling prices and other car-related attributes.
- **Add Car Feature**: Allows users to input details of a new car directly in the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations using matplotlib and seaborn.
- **Car Recommendations**: The code suggests the top 5 cars based on the best price-to-mileage ratio and engine specifications, tailored to the user's preferences.

## Results
- Selling price shows a clear decline with increasing car age.
- Duplicate records were identified and removed for cleaner analysis.
- Visualizations provided insights into trends between price and manufacturing year.
- The top 5 car recommendations are generated based on the best price-to-mileage ratio and least driven cars.
